# Abstract

The software in this open source project accesses particularly capable artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, tools that must be used ethically and morally by end users of this software and those who use it to build additional software. This project attempts to provide genuinely useful AI capabilities to people who can apply them for beneficial ends.

While these newer AI technologies have yielded truly useful results such as the synthesis of proteins that can aid in curing disease, there are numerous ways that AI capabilities may be used for significant harm to individuals and societies as a whole.

This document argues that care for people, living beings, and the ecosystem of Earth take precedence over the individual right to exercise arbitrary AI capabilities, however useful. When there is a conflict between the safety of our planet and its beings and usage of certain AI applications, then such AI uses must be restricted or outright denied for the benefit of all.

# AI for the People theses

The list of ideas follow from the [principles](#Principles-and-assumptions) listed further in the document. In this list, "artificial intelligence" or "AI" includes large language models (LLMs), face recognition, and any technologies that provide a similar level of capbility to mimic human expertise and ability:

* Human societies, not individuals, must decide when and how AI can be used and when its use is disallowed
* AI applications that are harmful to the Earth's ecosystem must be forbidden, even at the expense of human needs or desires
* AI must not be used to target a group of people for control or oppression or war
* AI applications that mimic human artistic expression must be weighed has having the least justification after explicitly harmful uses
* Each society must use its collectively controlled institutions to restrict AI use to acceptable applications
* Individuals are accountable for not using any AI technologies they judge to be harmful
* Individuals are accountable for collaborating to ensure their societies enact changes to restrict AI proactively and certainly when harm is evident

> When you use AI, use it for the People, not for power, since that belongs to the People!

# What is Artificial Intelligence?

Coming soon.

## Why is it useful?

Real-life examples, not speculation -- coming soon. For now, here's one:

* [2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Nobel_Prizes#Chemistry): Computational Protein Design (using AI)

## How is it dangerous?

Do you really need to ask? Coming soon. :)

# Principles and assumptions

This document assumes the truth of the following statements:

* All human beings have the same rights, there is no individual that has more rights than another
* Humans are just as important as all other living species on Earth
* All humans have the right to food, shelter, education, transportation, freedom of movement, freedom of association, to speak freely, the ability to pursue benign desires, to experience civility from fellow humans
* No being has the right to deny the above rights of humans
* Any tool that grants an individual or group the ability to deny rights the rights above must be restricted by humans collectively; such tools must not acccessible to an individual or a group that seeks to gain power or resources over / from others.
* The secular "human spirit" and its association with meaning in life is fundamental to human civilization and must be preserved

Some of these principles are simply assertions; others are based on observations of human history, such as repeated cycles of oppression of one group of humans by another, and the particular role that technology has played in giving powerful groups or individuals the ability to deprive all others of rights and even life.

## What are appropriate uses of AI?

... More to come!

## What are inappropriate / immoral uses of AI?

We'll get specific, but even unintentional harm at a scale that impacts the social fabric must be prevented. Also, here is one:

* AI generation of artistic output for group / mass consumption devalues the role of art in society which is fundamental to human expression, joy, and identity. The use of AI to generate art works for use beyond one generation is unacceptable in a society that values human existence.

# Who should use AI?

...People who are doing productive work for everyone in the society, are accountable for its impact, and who are also trained in AI's safe use. More to come.

## How do we make it safe to use?

We'll need to regulate the mechanisms for access to those that ensure safety. Such restriction of items such as weapons, corrosive chemicals, large vehicles, and many other things are already restricted, licensed, or otherwise regulated by institutions controlled by the people of a society.... more later.

## Philosophy

Did you think that the problems posed by AI are completely new, and no one has thought about them before? :) We've been around as a civilization long enough to encounter many forms of the questions raised by such powerful tools across cultures and time periods. We'll have a lot of philosophy tomes to dig through...

TBD.
