The State of (Useful) Artificial Intelligence
=============================================

What novel uses can artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as this project offer over non-AI software?

# When is AI useful today?

As of September 2025, the newest AI capabilities are broadly labeled as "generative AI" -- this category of software enables the generation of human like text, images, video, and speech. Text generation via large language models (LLMs) in particular allows us to have "conversations" with models trained for the purpose of responding with text that sounds like human text and even provides answers based on real-world facts. The following are areas where generative AI has demonstrated real value over pre-existing approaches:

1. Natural language user interface for traditional computer systems
2. Processing unstructured data, e.g. documents that contain numeric tables embedded in human prose
3. Assisting humans with software engineering and general engineering tasks
4. Authoring documents and text of various types and arbitrary human communication styles
5. Interactive queries to acquire knowledge / facts about the world
6. Generating images, video, music, and realistic real-time speech

ChatGPS aims to cover the first 5 areas with the overall goal of improving the productivity of users, expanding the kinds of problems they can solve, and eliminating tedious obligatory work. It is designed to encourage efficient rather than gratuitous usage of currently expensive resources such as language models, and to empower users to experiment and build rather than hope unrealistically for a magic answer machine.

Note that the ordering given above is intended to reflect the value of generative AI in that area, with the most valuable uses of generative AI listed first.

## Risks and downsides

Even in cases where the technology appears useful, it does come with risks:

* Non-determinism: Generative AI, much like a real human being, can give slightly different answers to the same question at different times or depending on how the question is asked and under what circumstances. It can even give wildly different and ultimately contradictory answers! Most modern human institutions assume and / or require consistency in decision-making and production of services, and for now generative AI is inconsistent, often in an unpredictable way. Adoption of generative AI in crucial processes of society could prove to be destablizing and even destructive.
* Hallucinations: Generative AI is known today for its "hallucinations," the production of human readable text that asserts the truth of known falsehoods. Arguments can be made that humans are no different in this way, but for humans accountability exists, including social pressure which leads to increased adherence to norms of truthfulness compared to language model output, which has no "incentive" toward honesty. More importantly, generative AI hallucinates on topics over which no human would realistically dissemble, such as the existence of magic or the behavior of gravity.

The replacement of traditional software infrastructure with such unreliable systems then is questionable: is the tradeoff in potential productivity (e.g. ability to replace human beings in a customer service support role for instance by using the natural language interaction capabilities of the models) still a net positive once the diminished reliability is considered?

## Evolutionary vs. revolutionary

It should also be noted that while generative AI  capabilities have shown utility as described above, I would not categorize them as revolutionary. One heuristic that leads to this conclusion is simply to ask the question "What would you do if you could no longer use generative AI?"

* There are almost no new kinds of applications where generative AI is core to the product's function -- the most-used applications are chat, image generation, and to some degree software code generation
* Generative AI has not (yet) replaced earlier modes of generating content. It can't because it is not currently readily accessible like electricity, water, or internet access. And its cost per use is still significant, which means it can only be used sparingly.
* Commercially, companies whose only product is generative AI have generated no profits -- they all currently operate at a loss, indicating that they do not yet provide net economic value for their costs.
* AI capabilities are being added to almost every major software product, yet user response is currently one of frustration and rejection of the capabilities; usage remains sporadic and low.

# What's next?

The software industry has identified "AI agents" as the next revolutionary product. The term "AI agent" lacks precision, but I will offer my own definitions:

* An **agent** is any software that executes instructions defined by a human user on behalf of that user using an explicitly or implicitly assigned identity.
  * Conceptually "agents" aren't new, they could simply be any software code executed by a human, whether binary code, script language code, etc.
  * Modern software offerings provide "low code / no code" solutions that let users define agent instructions using natural language graphical "workflows" instead of traditional code
* An **AI agent** is any such software where the user-defined instructions are expressed via natural natural language and / or the instructions utilize AI technologies at runtime to execute the user's instructions.
  * So augmenting earlier concepts of "agent" with AI at definition time or at runtime results in an "AI agent."

The apparent draw of AI agents vs. "normal" agents is that the use of AI, unlike that of traditional software instructions, allows such agents to exhibit behaviors beyond their specified instructions, and to take any reaonsable actions necessary to complete a goal rather than failing because the user did not specify every contingency and detailed corner case. Such software could perform tasks with the intelligence of a human being, and the number of these intelligent agents could far exceed the number of humans in existence, presumably at a fraction of the cost of human labor.

If AI agents were to reach this level of effectiveness, the result could then reasonably considered revolutionary, as much, if not most human labor would be rendered unnecessary, a situation unprecedented for human civilization in recorded history.

Today's reality though is that there is no technology including agents that demonstrates the general ability to replace human beings, even in fairly specialized tasks. And the agents, along with the current implementation of generative AI technology, remains resource intensive, and therefore too costly, and also too limited in its information processing capabilities to do more than offer marginal improvements over today's non-AI agents for users with the financial resources and need to use them.

This is the state of agents and related technologies today, though of course change in this area has been extremely rapid as of late.

# What about the future?

This is anyone's guess. While recent developments have caused a surge in prognostications of impending "Artificial General Intelligence" or better yet "Artificial SuperIntelligence" (!), the history of AI, at least as it relates the 20th and 21st century discipline of computer science has had multiple "winters" where once-promising technical approaches stalled for decades at a time. There is no reason to assume that progress in AI will follow particular exponential or even linear patterns. Like most complex systems, growth and change take on irregular and chaotic pacing.

What is likely more important for the future though than the next AI technology breakthrough or its capabilities is simply human agency and the choices we make with that agency. We can dictate our own future regarding AI vs. simply accepting such "progress" as inevitable. If we humans find themselves in an AI future that we despise, it is our own collective fault.

To ensure a future where we control our tools and they do not control us, we need to believe that there is a dignity and a noblity to human civilization that deserves to survive. We can look at some of the amazing accomplishments of our species despite sinking to depths that some might say justify our non-existence. Everything for which we can be proud came from collaborating each other and taking care of each other; it is our morality is what gives us, life, meaning, and the beauty and creativity that come with those things.

And if our civilization and its nobility of spirit are real and do indeed matter, then it is worth it for us to resist when we are told we must give up our agency to our creations. We must still do the hard work of caring for each other directly, and limiting our tools to only those uses that do not interpose themselves between each of us.
