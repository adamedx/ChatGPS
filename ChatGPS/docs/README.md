## About this documentation

The documentation for ChatGPS is simply the set of markdown files tracked under this directory within the repository. It consists of two main components:

* Static documentation located in the [current directory](.): These are manually authored files focused on conceptual and scenario-based topics.
* Command reference: The command reference provides detailed documentation of each command exposed by ChatGPS. These files are generated by automation that uses the inline PowerShell comment-based help within each command's source code.
